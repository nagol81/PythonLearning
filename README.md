## 1. Getting Started with the Bare Basics
To get started use the pluralsight training courses available in the Python Path looking at the Beginner course. This will get you started with the basics.
I opted for doing this in an linux environment to make it easier for future courses and practicals as not a lot of the packages are easily available on a Windows operating system.
